# Big Data Representations
This course was focused on analysis and handling of large datasets which cannot be held in memory all at once. Focus was given on completing queries with minimal passes through the full data.

The code here can complete many relevant queries when passed a numerical txt dataset, where entries are rows and features are columns (separated by commas). *iris.csv* and *iris_labels.csv* are included for testing.
