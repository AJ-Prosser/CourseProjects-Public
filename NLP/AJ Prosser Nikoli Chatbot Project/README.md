#Information to know if trying to run this on your own machine:
- I programmed this on a 2013 MacBook Air running MacOS Big Sur. This shouldn't cause any problems, as the OS commands should still function on Windows or Linux machines, but it's something to be aware of.

- The folders "outfiles" and "outfilesunprocessed" are not created or deleted by the webcrawler. This means that these folders must be present and empty in the directory the webcrawler is running for a fresh run of the program. To run the webcrawler a second time, just delete all of the files in these folders manualy.
    - The same goes with "usermodels" for the chatbot portion of this software.
